- **Research Value**: Correlation between crowding and uncertainty

### 3. Track Lengths Vary Significantly
- **Range**: Mean from 52 (Seq 05) to 573 (Seq 04) frames
- **Implication**: Different temporal contexts for uncertainty analysis

2. **Sufficient Occlusions**: 135 events for uncertainty spikes
3. **Good Track Retention**: 61/75 tracks meet min length
4. **Manageable Size**: 900 frames = reasonable compute time

- **Track 14**: Extended presence with high visibility
- **Track 32**: Stable motion patterns
- **Track 39**: Consistent throughout sequence

- **Track 30**: Multiple occlusions, varied durations
- **Track 29**: Frequent visibility changes
- **Track 18**: Occlusion patterns

## Spotlight: Track 25 - The Perfect Hero Track

**Why Track 25 is Exceptional for Temporal Uncertainty Analysis**:

- **Full Sequence Coverage**: Frames 1-900 (entire sequence)
- **8 Occlusion Events**: Multiple opportunities to study uncertainty spikes
- **Moderate Avg Visibility**: 0.618 (not too clean, not too noisy)
- **Static Motion**: 3.8 px avg displacement (motion not a confound)
- **Varied Occlusion Durations**:
  - Event 1: 7 frames (short)
  - Event 2: 58 frames (long)
  - Event 3: 62 frames (very long)

**Research Opportunities with Track 25**:
1. **Temporal Propagation**: How does uncertainty persist after occlusion?
2. **Recovery Dynamics**: How quickly does uncertainty decrease post-occlusion?
3. **Cross-Model Consistency**: Do all YOLOs show same uncertainty pattern?
4. **Occlusion Duration Effect**: Does longer occlusion = longer uncertainty?

**Experimental Timeline**:
```
Frames 1-7:    Initial occlusion (short)
Frames 9-66:   Extended occlusion #1 (58 frames)
Frames 67-185: Clean period (118 frames recovery)
Frames 186-247: Extended occlusion #2 (62 frames)
Frames 248+:   Remaining sequence
```

**Hypothesis to Test**:
> "Uncertainty for Track 25 will spike during occlusions and decay exponentially
> with time constant Ï„ after visibility returns. This pattern will correlate
> across all 5 YOLO models with r > 0.85, proving aleatoric nature."

## TTA Recommendations for Seq 11

### Occlusion Segments (High Uncertainty Expected)
1. **Frames 123-143**: Multiple concurrent occlusion events
2. **Frames 466-532**: Heavy occlusion period
3. **Frames 541+**: Final occlusion cluster

### Recommended Test Frames
Evenly spaced + interesting events: `[1, 91, 93, 181, 271, 361, 451, 516, 541, 631]`

These frames capture:
- Beginning (frame 1)
- Pre/during/post occlusion events (91, 93, 181)
- Clean periods (271, 361, 451)
- Heavy occlusion (516, 541)
- Late sequence (631)

## Statistical Highlights

### Occlusion Event Duration Distribution
- **1-10 frames**: 18 events (quick occlusions)
- **10-20 frames**: 15 events (medium occlusions)
- **20-50 frames**: 12 events (extended occlusions)
- **50+ frames**: 2 events (very long occlusions)

**Average**: 15.8 frames (~0.5 seconds at 30 fps)

### Crowding Patterns
- **Peak Crowding**: 19 simultaneous tracks (frame varies)
- **Sparse frames**: Low density periods exist
- **Medium frames**: Majority of sequence
- **Crowded frames**: Dense interaction periods

### Motion Analysis
- **Static tracks**: Minimal movement (good baseline)
- **Moving tracks**: Majority category
- **Fast-moving tracks**: High displacement events

## Next Steps: Implementation Priorities

Based on this analysis, our implementation should:

1. **Start with Seq 11, Track 25**:
   - Full sequence coverage
   - Multiple occlusion events
   - Perfect for temporal analysis

2. **Focus on Occlusion Segments**:
   - Frames 9-66, 186-247 are gold mines
   - Study uncertainty before, during, after

3. **Compare Clean vs Occluded**:
   - Frames 67-185 = clean baseline
   - Adjacent occlusions = direct comparison

4. **Validate Cross-Model Correlation**:
   - Run YOLOv8n first
   - Then YOLOv8s, m, l, x
   - Compute correlation matrix

5. **Temporal Propagation Model**:
   - Fit exponential decay to post-occlusion frames
   - Estimate time constant Ï„
   - Validate across multiple occlusion events

## Validation Against Ground Truth

All statistics are derived from MOT17 ground truth annotations, ensuring:
- **Accurate Occlusion Detection**: Using GT visibility field
- **True Track Lifetimes**: GT track IDs, not inferred
- **Reliable Statistics**: No heuristic-based estimation

**Confidence Level**: High - all findings are ground-truth validated.
