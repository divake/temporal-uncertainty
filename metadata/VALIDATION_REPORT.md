## Critical Issue: Visualization Track ID Labeling

### Problem Identified (Now Fixed)

**Before Fix**:
- Heatmap Y-axis showed row indices (0, 1, 2...) without track ID labels
- Gantt Y-axis showed position numbers without track ID labels
- Occlusion timeline showed event indices without track IDs
- User confusion: "Row 0" looked like "Track 0" but was actually "Track 1"

**Root Cause**:
Visualization code used `enumerate()` index for Y-position but didn't label Y-axis with actual MOT track IDs.

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Heatmap**: Added Y-axis labels showing actual MOT track IDs (sorted by duration)
2. **Gantt Chart**: Added Y-axis labels showing actual MOT track IDs (sorted by appearance)
3. **Occlusion Timeline**: Added labels in format "Evt X (TID:Y)" combining event index with track ID

**Status**: ✅ Fixed in code, all 42 plots regenerated

## Visualization Fixes Applied

### Files Modified

**Code**: `metadata/analysis_code/analyze_mot17_dataset.py`
- `plot_gantt_chart()`: Added track ID labels to Y-axis
- `plot_visibility_heatmap()`: Added track ID labels to Y-axis
- `plot_occlusion_timeline()`: Added track ID labels with event index

**Plots Regenerated**: All 42 plots (7 sequences × 6 plots each)
- ✓ seq02: gantt, heatmap, occlusion, crowding, track_length, entry_exit
- ✓ seq04: gantt, heatmap, occlusion, crowding, track_length, entry_exit
- ✓ seq05: gantt, heatmap, occlusion, crowding, track_length, entry_exit
- ✓ seq09: gantt, heatmap, occlusion, crowding, track_length, entry_exit
- ✓ seq10: gantt, heatmap, occlusion, crowding, track_length, entry_exit
- ✓ seq11: gantt, heatmap, occlusion, crowding, track_length, entry_exit
- ✓ seq13: gantt, heatmap, occlusion, crowding, track_length, entry_exit

### What Changed in Plots

#### 1. Visibility Heatmap
**Before**: Y-axis = row indices (0, 1, 2...)
**After**: Y-axis = actual MOT track IDs (1, 25, 14, 32...)

**Example for Seq11** (top 10 rows):
```
1   ← Track ID 1 (900 frames, longest)
25  ← Track ID 25 (900 frames, 2nd longest)
14  ← Track ID 14 (679 frames, 3rd longest)
32  ← Track ID 32 (484 frames)
39  ← Track ID 39 (364 frames)
13  ← Track ID 13 (285 frames)
6   ← Track ID 6 (268 frames)
31  ← Track ID 31 (261 frames)
5   ← Track ID 5 (255 frames)
42  ← Track ID 42 (224 frames)
```

#### 2. Gantt Chart
**Before**: Y-axis = position indices (0, 1, 2...)
**After**: Y-axis = actual MOT track IDs sorted by appearance

**Note**: Track 25 appears at Y-position 12 (among tracks starting at frame 1)

#### 3. Occlusion Timeline
**Before**: Y-axis = event indices (0, 1, 2...)
**After**: Y-axis = "Evt X (TID:Y)" format

**Example for Seq11**:
```
Evt 0 (TID:25)  ← Event 0 belongs to Track 25
Evt 1 (TID:25)  ← Event 1 belongs to Track 25
Evt 2 (TID:25)  ← Event 2 belongs to Track 25
Evt 3 (TID:1)   ← Event 3 belongs to Track 1
...
```
