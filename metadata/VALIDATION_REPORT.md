### ✅ TEST 16: Verify Scene Type Classifications
**Status**: PASSED (7/7 sequences)

Classification logic:
- `avg_crowding < 8` → street_low_density
- `8 ≤ avg_crowding < 15` → street_medium_density

```
Seq 02: crowding=31.0 → indoor_crowded ✓
Seq 04: crowding=45.3 → indoor_crowded ✓
Seq 05: crowding=8.3 → street_medium_density ✓
Seq 09: crowding=10.1 → street_medium_density ✓
Seq 10: crowding=19.6 → indoor_crowded ✓
Seq 11: crowding=10.5 → street_medium_density ✓
Seq 13: crowding=15.5 → indoor_crowded ✓
```

All classifications match expected values based on crowding thresholds.

---

### ✅ TEST 17: Verify No Missing Data
**Status**: PASSED

**Files Expected**: 58 total
- 7 sequences × 2 metadata files = 14 files
- 7 sequences × 6 visualizations = 42 plots
- 2 summary files (cross-sequence + hero tracks)

**Files Found**: 58 total ✓

All expected outputs are present.

---

### ✅ TEST 18: Check for Unrealistic Values
**Status**: PASSED (7/7 sequences)

Checked for:
- Negative or zero frame counts
- Negative or zero track counts
- Avg track length > total frames
